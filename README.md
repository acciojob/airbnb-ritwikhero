AIRBNB :

You are going to your favorite destination with your best friends from college. You have been given the duty to manage the whole trip and make bookings. You come across the website Airbnb and are fascinated by the backend system. Being a developer you try to visualize and decode the Airbnb Project.

Complete the Airbnb project by building different layers of the project. We have given only the controller layers. Make sure to make a service and repository layer and write the respective code in different layers of the project.

Note :

Don’t change the existing code
Use Hashmaps as a database.

Use the models as it is and don’t change any attributes in the same.

Incase the @Autowired Annotation does not work in connecting the different layers (controller, service and repository) please create the objects using the new keyword For Eg UserService userService = new UserService(); instead of doing @Autowired annotation

Don’t use the lombok library and its annotations
